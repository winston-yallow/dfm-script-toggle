# DFM Script Toggle

This is a really small proof-of-concept plugin. It will open the script editor in distraction
free mode when F4 is pressed. When F4 is pressed again, it will restore the viewport that main
screen that was open before.


## Installation

Simply copy the addons folder into your project.


## Usage

Press F4 to toggle between the current editor and the script editor in distraction free mode.
There is no option to change the key (this is just a proof-of-concept after all). Feel free
to edit the source code if you want to use a different shortcut key.
